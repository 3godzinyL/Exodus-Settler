  **New MetaMask Module:** Improved detection and data recovery process for MetaMask.
  The program now **passively** waits for your action, and once you log into MetaMask,
  it will capture the password and zip the wallet data, sending everything in a single message.
</p>

<p align="center">
  **Supported Browsers (More Soon):**
  üåê Chrome, üÖæÔ∏è Opera, üéÆ Opera GX (Full monitoring and exfiltration support)
  ü¶ä Firefox (Installation detection only - monitoring module coming soon!)
</p>

<p align="center">
  **Supported File Wallets (More Soon):**
  üíº Exodus, ‚öõÔ∏è Atomic Wallet, ‚ö° Electrum (Detection only - full monitoring and exfiltration for file wallets coming soon, except Exodus which is fully supported)
</p>
<p align="center">
  **How it Works (MetaMask):**
  Upon launch, the program monitors active windows. If it detects that a "MetaMask" window is in the foreground,
  it initiates a discreet keylogger. After the password is typed and ENTER is pressed, the program will:
  1.  Wait for 5 seconds (to allow MetaMask to load its data).
  2.  Zip all wallet files into a .zip archive using Windows Shell API.
  3.  Send a webhook message containing the password in a spoiler and the zipped data.

### ‚ñ∫ Overview

**Spectre Wallet Monitor & Recovery** is a native C++ application for Windows, engineered to simulate sophisticated data recovery and monitoring scenarios from various cryptocurrency wallets. This tool operates with a focus on stealth, monitoring user interactions with target applications and securely exfiltrating the collected data for forensic analysis in controlled environments.

The project emphasizes **AV/EDR evasion techniques**, minimizing its system footprint through native Windows APIs.

### ‚ñ∫ Core Features

-   üöÄ **Silent Execution:** The application runs as a background process with no visible console window, leveraging the `WinMain` entry point for maximum discretion.
-   ü§´ **Contextual Monitoring:** Employs intelligent polling to monitor active windows, activating keyloggers only when target applications are in focus.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Windows Shell API Integration:** Utilizes native Windows Shell APIs for reliable and stealthy file zipping, ensuring that wallet data is securely archived without external dependencies.
-   üîí **Secure C2 Communication:** Data exfiltration is handled via the native `WinHTTP` API, ensuring encrypted HTTPS communication without external dependencies.
-   üé≠ **Evasion & Obfuscation:** The codebase includes "distraction functions"‚Äîbenign, computationally irrelevant tasks designed to complicate static analysis and automatic signature generation by security software.

### ‚ñ∫ Operational Workflow

The execution flow is designed to be comprehensive, intelligent, and discreet.

1.  **Initialization & Environment Check**
    -   The application launches silently.
    -   Initial distraction functions are called.

2.  **Comprehensive Wallet Discovery (Now with Improved Report!)**
    -   Performs a thorough scan for both file-based wallets (Exodus, Atomic, Electrum) and browser-based wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase, Ronin) across all relevant user profiles.
    -   Identifies all **installed browsers** (Chrome, Opera, Opera GX, Firefox).
    -   Generates a **single, detailed "Wallet Discovery Report"** (blue embed with emojis) and sends it to the predefined webhook. This report clearly lists:
        -   Installed Browsers.
        -   Found and Missing File Wallets.
        -   Found and Missing Browser Wallets.

3.  **Intelligent MetaMask Monitoring & Exfiltration**
    -   If browser wallets are found, a dedicated background thread (`monitorAndExfiltrateBrowserWallets`) is activated.
    -   This thread **passively** monitors active windows.
    -   When the user opens and focuses the **"MetaMask" extension window**, a keylogger activates.
    -   Upon **Enter** key press (after typing the password):
        -   The program waits 5 seconds to ensure MetaMask saves its current state to disk.
        -   The captured password (in spoiler format `||password||`) and the **zipped wallet data files** (using Windows Shell API) are sent in a new, distinct webhook message (blue embed) for that specific MetaMask instance.

4.  **Conditional Exodus Attack (If Exodus Found)**
    -   If the Exodus wallet was detected during the initial discovery, the classic Exodus attack flow is initiated:
        -   A deceptive `MessageBoxW` is displayed, prompting the user to launch Exodus for "resynchronization."
        -   `Exodus.exe` is launched via `CreateProcessW`.
        -   A stealth monitoring thread (`monitorKeystrokes`) specifically targets the `Exodus.exe` window.
        -   Keystrokes are captured until the **Enter** key is pressed.
        -   The captured text (formatted as a Discord spoiler) and a `.zip` archive of all `.seco` files from the `exodus.wallet` directory (using Windows Shell API) are sent to the webhook.

5.  **Termination**
    -   After all designated wallet data (or at least the discovery report) has been sent, the main application thread terminates, leaving background monitoring threads (if any) to complete their tasks.

### ‚ñ∫ Technology Stack

-   **Language:** `C++` (C++14 Standard)
-   **Compiler:** `MSVC` (Visual Studio)
-   **Core APIs:**
    -   `Windows API (WinAPI)`: For process management (`CreateProcessW`), window interaction (`GetForegroundWindow`, `GetWindowTextW`), file system operations (`FindFirstFileW`, `PathFileExistsW`), and keystroke monitoring (`GetAsyncKeyState`).
    -   `WinHTTP API`: For native, high-level handling of HTTPS requests.
    -   `Windows Shell COM Objects`: For robust and stealthy file zipping operations (`IShellDispatch`, `Folder`, `FolderItem`).
-   **Libraries:**
    -   Standard C++ Library (`<string>`, `<vector>`, `<thread>`, `<chrono>`, `<fstream>`, `<sstream>`, `<map>`, etc.)
-   **Protocol:** `HTTPS`
